# **Turing Machine Modules Simulation**
A Python project to simulate a Turing Machine with built-in modules.

The program is tested with the following test cases:
1. Finding the greatest common divisor (GCD)
2. Finding the square root of a number
3. Printing numbers in ascending order
4. Printing numbers in descending order
5. Sorting three numbers
